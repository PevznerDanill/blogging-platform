[{"model": "app_blog.post", "pk": 1, "fields": {"title": "The Great Ideological Lie of Diversity", "tag": "Diversity lies", "content": "If you are a Canadian faculty member, there is a reasonable chance that you recently received an email or letter from Statistics Canada. The Survey of Postsecondary Faculty and Researchers was designed to assess what has come to be known as “diversity” among the groups targeted, in consequence of a commitment made by the three Canadian research granting councils, under guidance from the federal Liberal government, to increase “diversity” among those receiving funding. It has long been the case that research funding was dependent, as much as possible, on two factors, both intensely meritocratic: the research record of the applicant and the quality of the proposed research. That appears about to change.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this occurrence motivated me to try my hand at writing a critique of the concept of diversity, which is a very slippery term. What it truly means is “let’s aim for fewer white men in positions of authority,” which would be a fine idea if race and sex were reasonable criteria by which to judge applicants, and if it wasn’t motivated by a broad set of “progressive” beliefs, which include the idea that we live in an oppressive patriarchy and that men who work now should be required to step back so that a litany of hypothetical, indefinable and prejudicial historical wrongs might be righted (this even though those who do the righting weren’t those who committed the prejudicial crimes, so to speak, and those who benefit not those who were the victims). There was even a recent article in Nature, a magazine that was once, with Science, one of the two unquestionably most influential scientific journals, suggesting that male scientist should voluntarily delay their career advancement so that their underprivileged colleagues (underprivileged despite their status as university professors) could catch up and justice properly served.\r\n\r\n“Diversity” is a word that, on the face of it, masquerades as something positive—because it is positive, in some of its manifestations. It’s obviously not helpful to set up an organization where everyone thinks alike, or solely in the approved manner. It is necessary, for example, for healthy organizations to ally the conservative tendency to preserve with the more liberal tendency to transform. But that begs the question: where is diversity to be found? Among the ideologues who were pushing the “progressive” doctrine that it’s part of, most frequently including “inclusivity, equity and intersectionality,” it is to be found in a set of immutable characteristics that typify different groups, including race, sex, gender (because that is distinguished by those same ideologues from sex) and sexual proclivity, above all.\r\n\r\nThere are real problems with this agenda, however. The first is that it’s dangerous, in exactly the manner it is hypothetically designed to fight. The argument made by those who are truly prejudiced has always been that the differences between groups are so large that discrimination, isolation, segregation and even open conflict–including war and genocide–are necessary, for the safety of whatever group they are part of and are hypothetically protecting. Why is it any less risky for the argument to be made in the reverse manner? The claim that group-based differences are so important that they must take substantive priority during hiring and promotion merely risks validating the opposite claim.\r\n\r\nThere’s a second problem, too—and it’s particularly interesting, because it has been made by the same ideologically-oriented groups on the left that are pushing the diversity agenda: considering race, say and gender when making diversity decisions is not sufficient. Diversity that focuses on females is insufficient, because black, Asian or Hispanic women, for example, face more egregious prejudice than white women. This brings us to the last word of the progressive set—“intersectionality.” For the ideologues of intersectionality, true diversity cannot be limited to the features we have already considered—race and the like—because many people are alienated or, in the jargon, “marginalized,” from the broader culture by more than one oppressed minority feature. In consequence, the “intersection” between the groups must be considered for any real justice to make its appearance as a consequence of policy.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely problematic theory, practically speaking (and this is the second problem, in addition to the danger just outlined), in that there appear to be no limits, practically or philosophically, to the number of group memberships that have to be taken into account for true diversity to establish itself (and I mean this non-ironically). It doesn’t take much thought—just a little arithmetic—to determine the nature of the problem: There are just too many potential intersectional categories. Let’s break it down.\r\n\r\nThere’s race and sex, for starters—and plenty of attention is paid to both—and, following that, gender, which seems to come in something approximating second place in terms of import. But how many races, sexes and genders is it required to consider? Assume, for the sake of argument (and this is what the modern science suggests) that there are five major human subpopulations: African, European/Middle Eastern, East Asian, inhabitants of Oceania, and denizens of the New World. Let’s assume two sexes and three genders—although many of those concerned with diversity, etc., would insist that there are a much larger number of the latter.  So that’s 5X2X3 =30.\r\n\r\nThen we might as well add to that disabilities, which are extraordinarily common (particularly when you consider that many people who are not actively ill in some major manner, physical or mental, are faced with the exceptional stress that comes with caring for a family member who is).I don’t know how to calculate the appropriate number here, although but according to the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics, 20% of undergraduates[1] reported a disability in 2015-2016. These include “those who reported that they had one or more of the following conditions: blindness or visual impairment that cannot be corrected by wearing glasses; hearing impairment (e.g., deaf or hard of hearing); orthopedic or mobility impairment; speech or language impairment; learning, mental, emotional, or psychiatric condition (e.g., serious learning disability, depression, ADD, or ADHD); or other health impairment or problem.”[2] So, if we assume that two divisions (presence/ absence) are necessary to cover each disability (counting each listed in the last phrase separately), we’re now require nine additional multiples of 2 (two for blindness, two for hearing impairment, etc.) for our equation:\r\n\r\nSo that’s 30 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2=15360.\r\n\r\nI can’t see why class/economic origin shouldn’t be taken into account as well. According to the U.S. Census Bureau estimates, 12% of Americans live below the poverty line. So, we need at least an additional two categories to account for economic disparity, and that’s a very coarse grained measure. And that brings us to 30720 categories of “diverse” individuals (15360X2). If we are truly serious about diversity, and are willing to attribute it to group identity, and are going to apply its dictates to hiring, placement and promotion for every position, then we have a minimum of ~thirty thousand different categories to consider—and there are many other categories of exclusion that are arguably of equal import (such that it is difficult to determine why it was that race, sex and gender occupy so much attention).\r\n\r\nThere’s height, strength and attractiveness, which all arguably provide an unequal starting place in the race for success. There’s intelligence, native language and education. There’s age, marital status and—of critical importance—presence or absence of dependent children. That’s nine more categories. Assuming we once again use two divisions for each additional category (short/tall, strong/weak, etc.), the total of “diverse” individuals now exceeds fifteen million.\r\n\r\n30720 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2 X 2=15728640\r\n\r\nWe’d only need to add one more binary category (obese/non-obese (?)) to exceed the entire 18 million person workforce of Canada. And why not? Who’s to say, given that elimination of discrimination is hypothetically the goal, that one more important than another? I say this in all seriousness: Isn’t that just another form of discrimination?\r\n\r\nAnd there are great problems even with the categories that seem, on the surface, relatively simple—let’s say, race. The geneticists, as I mention, consider five (and even those don’t overlap perfectly with the categories that are used politically: Hispanic, for example—a favorite unique to the US—is  more of a linguistic category, although those described that are often of mixed European and New World origin). But why is it reasonable to stop at five? Let’s take the case of “black,” for example. First, we could note that blacks who immigrate to the US do better, in general, than blacks who are born American. This is true for education[3] (black immigrants are more likely than Americans, in general, to have a college degree) as well as income ($43,800, somewhat lower than immigrants to the US in general ($48,000, a figure inflated by the outsized economic attainments of Asians: $70,600) but substantially higher than U.S. born blacks ($33,500). (Americans overall average $52,000).\r\n\r\nDo we therefore differentiate blacks on the basis of their place of birth, and add another category to the diversity pool? And we could also make a very strong scientific case for even further differentiation. Are we truly to be satisfied with the claim that all blacks are the same, even independently of birthplace?  For example, there is much more genetic diversity among Africans—the putative home of humanity—than among all other non-African populations.[4] [5]This is in large part because the apparently small number of migrations out of Africa to the rest of the world produced a variability bottleneck: a relatively small number of people moved, and so a relatively small amount of genetic diversity existed. By what logic, therefore, is it reasonably to cluster all these people together, call them “black,” and assume that organizational diversity justice has been served, say, by their increased rates of hiring, promotion and placement?\r\n\r\nAnd let’s return to the beginning. As far as I am concerned, unless you accept it as a dogmatic given (and this would be if you were an advocate of the “equity” doctrine, which means that all outcomes for all groups in all professions must be identical, and which therefor runs into the same arithmetical problem that diversity encounters, as described previously) university hiring and granting practices are remarkably meritocratic. In the university departments I have worked within (McGill, Harvard and the University of Toronto) it was obvious to everyone that within the limits of human error, which are of course manifold, people were promoted when they deserved it and obtained research grant money for the same reasons. In both cases, the more productive people had a pronounced edge, which is exactly how it should be if scientific research is important enough to garner investment, be it from private or public funding sources. The three granting agencies are as meritocratic as our somewhat (and inevitably) flawed measures of research productivity can make them, and the universities themselves bend over backwards and tie themselves in knots (both clichés are necessary) to right past wrongs—to the point where, according to the well-respected social scientists Wendy Williams and Stephen Ceci in their demonstrated a 2:1 hiring advantage for female candidates for open science, technology, engineering and mathematical positions.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, I would like to suggest that the proper way to determine who gets what slice of which pie in a given organization is the manner in which employers are legally bound to hire: first, they must conduct an analysis of the job to determine and list its requirements; then, with certain exceptions they are required to hire, place or promote the person who is most qualified to undertake that job, regardless of attributes that are not relevant to the task. These include, in my opinion, the differences in race, sex, gender, and their combinations (as well as the other intrinsic differences we discussed) that are pushed so assiduously, self-righteously and thoughtlessly by the progressives who think they can replace comparatively well-functioning meritocracies, aimed at the solution of serious problems by the most qualified people with candidates chosen on the basis of attributes that would clearly be viewed as prejudicial if they were used as grounds for rejection, failure to promote, and firing.\r\n\r\nA final observation. The fact of the endless multiplication of categories of victimization, let’s say—or at least difference—was actually solved long ago by the Western emphasis on the individual. We essentially assumed that each person was characterized by so many differences than every other person (the ultimate in “intersectionality”) that it was better to concentrate solely on meritocratic selection, where the only difference that was to be considered was the suitability of the person for the specific and well-designed tasks that constituted a given job. That works—not perfectly, but less imperfectly than anything else that has been contemplated or worse, implemented. We toy with it at our peril.", "created_at": "2023-04-30T09:50:51.783Z", "is_published": true, "published_at": "2023-05-07T19:30:32.075Z", "blog": 2, "profile": 4}}, {"model": "app_blog.post", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "I Didn’t Say That", "tag": "diversity", "content": "Something very strange and disturbing happened to me this week. If it was just relevant to me, it wouldn’t be that important (except perhaps to me), and I wouldn’t be writing this column about it. But it’s something that is likely more important and more ominous than we can even imagine.There are already common fraudulent schemes being perpetrated by both telephone and internet. One know as the “Grandparent Scam” is particularly reprehensible, first because it is perpetrated on elderly people who are, in general, more susceptible to tech-savvy criminals and second because it is based on the manipulation of familial love, trust, and compassion. The criminal running the Grandparent Scam calls or emails the victim, pretending to represent a grandchild who is now in trouble with the law or who needs money for a hospital bill for an injury that can’t be discussed, say, with parents, because of the moral trouble that might ensue. They generally call late at night—say at four in the morning—because that adds to the confusion. The preferred mechanism of money movement is wire transfer—and that’s a warning: don’t transfer money by wire without knowing for certain who is receiving it, because once it’s gone, it’s not coming back.Now what if it was possible to conduct such a scam using the actual voice of the hypothetical victim? Worse, what if was possible to do so with voice and video image, indistinguishable from the real thing? If we’re not at that point now (and we probably are) we will be within months.In April of this year, a company called Coding Elite exposed an artificial intelligence (AI) program that to a substantial sample of my voice, which is easily accessible on the YouTube lectures and podcasts that I have posted over the last years. In consequence, they were able to duplicate my manner of speaking with exceptional precision, starting out by producing versions of me rapping Eminem songs such as Lose Yourself (which has now garnered 250,000 views) and Rap God (which has only garnered 17,000) as well as Rock Lobster (1400 views). They have done something similar with Bernie Sanders (singing Dancing Queen), Donald Trump (Sweet Dreams) and Ben Shapiro, who also delivered Rap God. The company has a model, the address of which you can find on their YouTube channel, which allows the use to make Trump, Obama, Clinton or Sanders say anything whatsoever.I happen to think Rap God is an amazing piece of work, and when I first encountered my verbal avatar belting out the lyrics I thought that it was cool, in a teenage tech-geek sort of way. And I suppose it was. This caused quite a stir on the net in April, with media companies such as Forbes and Motherboard (a division of Vice) noting that the machine learning technology only required six hours of original audio (that is, actually generated by me) to produce its credible fakes, matching rhythm, stress, sound and prose intonation.This week, however, a company called notjordanpeterson.com put an AI engine online that allows anyone to type anything and have it reproduced in my voice. It’s hard to get access to or use the site, at the moment, presumably because it is currently attracting more traffic than its servers can handle. [NOTE: As of August 23, this website posted the following announcement: In light of Dr. Peterson’s response to the technology demonstrated by this site, which you can read here, and out of respect for Dr. Peterson, the functionality of the site will be disabled for the time being.]A variety of sites that pass themselves off as news portals—and sometimes are—have either reported this story straight (Sputnik News) or had a field day (Gizmodo) having me read, for example, the SCUM manifesto (hypothetically an acronym for Society for Cutting Up Men), a radical feminist rant by Valerie Solanos published in 1967. Solanos, by the way, later shot the artist Andy Warhol, an act, driven by her developing paranoia. He was seriously wounded, requiring a surgical corset to hold his organs in place for the rest of his life. TNW takes a middle path, reporting the facts of the situation with little bias but using the system to have me voice very vulgar phrases.Some of you might know—and those of you who don’t should—that similar technology has also been developed for video. This was reported, for example, by BBC, as far back in July of 2017, who broadcast a speech delivered by an AI Obama, that was essentially indistinguishable from the real thing. Similar technology has been used, equally notoriously, to superimpose the faces of famous actresses on porn stars, while they perform their various sexual exploits (you can find this story covered, for example, on The Verge, Jan 24, 2018). Movies have also been reshot so that the main actor is transformed from someone unknown to someone with real box office draw. This has happened, for example, to Nicolas Cage, primarily on a YouTube site known as Derpfakes, a play on the phrase “Deep Fakes,” which is what the video recordings created fraudulently by AI have come to be known. More recently Ctrl Shift Face, a YouTube channel, posted a video showing Bill Hader transforming very subtly into Tom Cruise as he performs an impression of the latter on Dave Letterman’s show. It’s picked up four million views in a week. It’s important to note, by the way, that this ability is available to amateurs. I don’t mean people with no tech knowledge whatsoever, obviously—more that the electronic machinery that makes such things possible will soon be within the reach of everyone.It’s hard to imagine a technology with more power to disrupt. I’m already in the position (as many of you soon will be as well) where anyone can produce a believable audio and perhaps video of me saying absolutely anything they want me to say. How can that possible be fought? More to the point: how are we going to trust anything electronically-mediated in the very near future (say, during the next Presidential election)? We’re already concerned, rightly or wrongly, with “fake news”—and that’s only news that has been slanted, arguably, by the bias of the reporter or editor or news organization. What do we do when “fake news” is just as real as “real news”? What do we do when anyone can imitate anyone else, for any reason that suits them?And what of the legality of this process? It seems to me that active and aware lawmakers would take immediate steps to make the unauthorized production of AI Deep Fakes a felony offense, at least in the case where the fake is being used to defame, damage or deceive. And it seems to be that we should perhaps throw caution to the wind, and make this an exceptionally wide-ranging law. We need to seriously consider the idea that someone’s voice is an integral part of their identity, of their reality, of their person—and that stealing that voice is a genuinely criminal act, regardless (perhaps) of intent. What’s the alternative? Are we entering a future where the only credible source of information will be direct personal contact? What’s that going to do to mass media, of all types? Why should we not assume that the noise to signal ratio will creep so high that all political and economic information disseminated broadly will be rendered completely untrustworthy?I can tell you from personal experience, for what that’s worth, that it is far from comforting to discover an entire website devoted to allowing whoever is inspired to do so produce audio clips imitating my voice delivering whatever content the user chooses—for serious, comic or malevolent purposes. I can’t imagine what the world will be like when we will truly be unable to distinguish the real from the unreal, or exercise any control whatsoever on what videos reveal about behaviors we never engaged in, or audio avatars broadcasting any opinion at all about anything at all. I see no defense, and a tremendously expanded opportunity for unscrupulous troublemakers to warp our personal and collective reality in any manner they see fit.Wake up. The sanctity of your voice, and your image, is at serious risk. It’s hard to imagine a more serious challenge to the sense of shared, reliable reality that keeps us linked together in relative peace.

From this trove of data — the largest collection of mammalian genetic sequences yet — they have learnt more about why some mammals can smell particularly well, why others hibernate and why some have developed larger brains. The effort, called the Zoonomia Project, reported these and other findings in a series of 11 papers in Science on 27 April.\r\nThe data highlight not only which areas of the genomes are similar, but also when, on the scale of millions of years, their genetic sequences diverged. “This really wasn’t possible without this scale of data set before,” says Katie Pollard, a data scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is part of the project.\r\n\r\nSequencing so many mammalian species is an enormous accomplishment, says David Haussler, scientific director of the Genomics Institute at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “We were always dreaming about that.” Haussler helped to sequence the first human genome in the early 2000s.\r\n\r\nMining the data\r\nThose first mammalian genomes published long ago were a good start, says Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden who is one of the leaders of Zoonomia. But she and her colleagues realized that they would need more than 200 genomes to offer a statistically significant glimpse at how mammalian species had changed over time — especially if they wanted to zoom in on genetic changes at the level of single DNA base pairs.\r\nThe Zoonomia consortium, which includes more than 150 scientists and 30 research teams from around the world, made its 240 genomes available to the public for the first time in 20202. Since then, the researchers have looked for similarities among them. They hypothesized that if certain segments of the genomes were similar — and remained so over tens of millions of years across species — those segments must serve an important function for these animals. In one analysis, a team used this concept to estimate that at least 10.7% of the human genome is identical to those of almost all of the species the researchers studied3. Most of these ‘conserved’ areas are so-called regulatory genes, which modulate how and when other genes are transcribed and ultimately translated into proteins. The function of about half of these conserved genes were previously unknown.\r\n\r\nOther analyses looked at how the genomes differ, highlighting the way that certain traits such as the sense of smell evolved, but also pointing researchers to which genes contribute to disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have already compared thousands of human genomes to identify variants that are linked with disease4. But finding the precise genes that aren’t just linked to, but cause a disease, has proved difficult, especially for conditions that have millions of associated genes. Seeing how those genes have evolved over time in all mammals can help to narrow the search “by an order of magnitude”, Lindblad-Toh says.\r\n\r\nUsing Zoonomia’s data, researchers have also constructed a phylogenetic tree that estimates when each mammalian species diverged from its ancestors5. This analysis lends support to the hypothesis that mammals had already started evolutionarily diverging before Earth was struck by the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago — but that they diverged much more rapidly afterwards.\r\n\r\nOnly the beginning\r\nThe Zoonomia Project is just one of dozens of efforts to sequence animal genomes. Another large effort is the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), which aims to generate genomes for roughly all 71,000 living vertebrate species, which include mammals, reptiles, fish, birds and amphibians. Although the two projects are independent of one another, many researchers are a part of both, says Haussler, who is a trustee of the VGP.\r\nHaving so many mammalian genomes is a feat, says Walter Jetz, an ecologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, but Zoonomia’s database so far has a bias towards species with large bodies and those that are not from tropical regions. Sequencing a greater diversity of mammals will allow researchers to draw more authoritative conclusions about mammalian evolution, he says. Lindblad-Toh says the project aimed to select a wide range of species to sample, but that the more mammals added to this data set, the more powerful it will be. “We’re entering an exponential phase of genome sequencing with mammals and other groups,” says Nathan Upham, an evolutionary biologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who was not involved with the research.\r\n\r\nElinor Karlsson, a geneticist at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester, who is one of the leaders of Zoonomia, points out that the data are publicly available on the project’s website. “We’re really hoping more people are going to start figuring out all the questions that could be asked with these data sets,” she says.\r\n\r\nZoonomia isn’t the culmination of research in mammal genomics — it’s only the beginning, Upham says. The past 20 years were about learning how to properly sequence genomes, he adds. “Now we’re just starting to really dive deep into the genomes.”", "created_at": "2023-05-02T09:25:38.433Z", "is_published": true, "published_at": "2023-05-02T09:40:33.828Z", "blog": 7, "profile": 9}}, {"model": "app_blog.post", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "White House to tap cancer leader Monica Bertagnolli as new NIH director", "tag": "vih cancer usa", "content": "In a hotly anticipated decision, the White House will probably nominate Monica Bertagnolli, the current head of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), to lead the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) next week, a source who is familiar with the decision told Nature.\r\n\r\nIf confirmed by the US Senate, Bertagnolli will take over the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world — based in Bethesda, Maryland — which has a budget of more than US$47 billion and is composed of 27 separate institutes and centres. The selection comes nearly a year and a half after geneticist Francis Collins, who helmed the agency for more than 12 years, stepped down in December 2021.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think there could be a better choice for this role,” says Suzanne George, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, who has worked with Bertagnolli. “As a leader, she brings people together to tackle new challenges in novel, innovative and inclusive ways.”\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Bertagnolli’s planned nomination on 19 April.\r\n\r\nCancer surgeon\r\nAfter serving a brief six-month stint as the first female NCI director, Bertagnolli would be the second permanent female director of the NIH if she is confirmed.\r\n\r\nA cancer surgeon, Bertagnolli was the first woman to lead the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s surgical-oncology division. Her research focused on the genetic mutations that lead to gastrointestinal cancer and how inflammation stimulates cancer growth.\r\n\r\nShe has also been president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, an organization in Alexandria, Virginia, that represents cancer physicians, and has led the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, a network that works with the NCI to develop and conduct cancer clinical trials.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Jaffee, a cancer immunologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who leads US President Joe Biden’s cancer advisory panel, says Bertagnolli has a knack for bringing companies, government agencies and patient-advocacy groups together to accomplish her vision. This skill will serve Bertagnolli well as she steps up to oversee research that is beyond her field of immediate expertise and pushes Congress to fund the agency.\r\n\r\nIn December, Bertagnolli announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. At an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Orlando, Florida, this week, Bertagnolli said that her treatment had gone well and that her prognosis is “incredibly good”.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a walk in the park,” she said of the experience. “But I’ve had tremendous support.” Bertagnolli also noted that she was a participant in a clinical trial to develop a new diagnostic testing approach.\r\n\r\nChallenges ahead\r\nThat it has taken more than a year to find Collins’s replacement has raised some concerns given the NIH’s broad research portfolio and its role in funding COVID-19 research.\r\n\r\nThe potential nomination coincides with House Republicans vowing to investigate the NIH’s role related to the pandemic. The Senate confirmation process for NIH director picks is usually uncontroversial, but some worry that the politicization of science during the COVID-19 pandemic might erode the bipartisan support that the NIH has typically received.\r\n\r\nThe next NIH director will have their work cut out for them: not only will they have to manage congressional probes, but researchers have called on the NIH to take bold action to bolster the diversity of the biomedical workforce, quicken the pace of innovation and ensure the agency continues to fund research at a rate matching inflation.\r\n\r\nLawrence Shulman, a clinician and specialist in health-services research at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says that Bertagnolli is a visionary leader. “It’s like a chess game, she’s always thinking several steps ahead,” he says. “She has a long experience of understanding cancer medicine from the trenches but also understands how large organizations work.”\r\n\r\nIn particular, Shulman says, her push to accelerate clinical trials and diversify the populations enrolled in trials at the NCI, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland, will be a welcome change if applied to the NIH at large.\r\n\r\nThe White House and Bertagnolli did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Когда я это понял, то на полном серьёзе, посмотрел наверх и поблагодарил Бога за то, что он меня идиота – не так, так эдак оберегает. \r\n\r\nПродолжение ⏩", "created_at": "2023-05-04T07:44:16.098Z", "is_published": false, "published_at": null, "blog": 4, "profile": 6}}, {"model": "app_blog.post", "pk": 14, "fields": {"title": "ВНУТРИДНЕВНОЕ ПРЕРЫВИСТОЕ ГОЛОДАНИЕ.

ПГ можно разделить на две основные категории: внутринедельное голодание – день через день, голодание два раза в неделю и внутридневное голодание, имеющее ограничение по времени периода приёма пищи. Наиболее частый, внутридневной вариант ПГ – это 16 часовой период голода и 8 часовой – кормления, обозначаемый 16/8. Его я сегодня и разберу. Итак, суть ПГ сводится к ограничению по времени периодов поста и кормления. Да, всё верно, весь свой дневной рацион питания употребляется в 8 часовом окне. Собственно, благодаря этому и достигается эффект снижения употребления пищи. Поясню, напомнив, что первичное насыщение, в основном, регулируется степенью давления на барорецепторы, расположенных ниже соединения пищевода с желудком. При раздражении этих рецепторов, центры насыщения в головном мозге получают сигналы о наполнении желудка, что и приводит к снижению аппетита и быстрому насыщению. Вторичное же, или истинное, насыщение наступает через 1,5-2 часа с момента приема пищи, когда в кровь поступает глюкоза, жирные и аминокислоты. Т.е. эффект контроля голода на ПГ обусловлен, в основном рассинхронизацией между первичным и вторичным насыщением. Это значит, что без каких-либо ограничений калорийности, на ПГ мы должны меньше есть в принципе. Давайте посмотрим на двухнедельное перекрёстное исследование PMID: 23702187, в котором молодые здоровые мужчины питались, либо традиционно, либо с ограничением времени кормления, за пределами которого они могли есть всё что хотели. Оказалось, что без каких-либо ограничений или подсчётов – питание в формате ПГ снизило потребление энергии, в среднем на 244 ккал/день. Кстати, отказ от еды после какого-то магического часа, например, 18.00 – это не что иное, как ПГ, которое приводит к снижению веса, только в случае создания суточного дефицита энергии.", "created_at": "2023-05-04T08:03:47.584Z", "is_published": true, "published_at": "2023-05-04T08:07:44.170Z", "blog": 4, "profile": 6}}, {"model": "app_blog.post", "pk": 15, "fields": {"title": "ТРЕНИРОВОЧНЫЙ ОБЪЁМ ПРИ НАБОРЕ И ПОДДЕРЖАНИИ МЫШЕЧНОЙ МАССЫ.", "tag": "#линдовер_тренировки_", "content": "Долго я искал материал для написания этого поста, и вот он собран и осмыслен. Итак, любой практик знает, что набор мышечной массы и её поддержание требует различных тренировочных объёмов, который в бодибилдинге принято оценивать в количестве подходов. Более того, спортсмены прекрасно знакомы с блоковой периодизацией, которая предполагает чередование мезоциклов, продолжительностью 4-6 недель. В каждый из этих блоков выполняется развивающая работа над конкретным спортивным качеством, например, силой, выносливостью, скоростью и т.д. При этом, чтобы сохранить результаты, полученные в первом блоке – во второй добавляется, так называемая тонизирующая работа из первого. Разница между этой самой развивающей, приводящей к соответствующим адаптациям и тонизирующей работой в тренировочном объёме, может достигать 3-6 раз. Теперь от спортивных качеств к мышечной массе, для наращивания которой к мышечному аппарату необходимо предъявлять всё новые и новые требования, называемые прогрессивной перегрузкой. Причина, по которой организм не спешит строить мышцы в том, что это крайне дорогостоящая и прожорливая в энергетическом плане ткань, т.е. невыгодная для организма. При этом, если мышечная масса выросла, то для её поддержания нужно просто использовать мышцы таким образом, чтобы организм осознавал необходимость их дорогостоящего содержания. Короче говоря, мышцы, которые мы используем организм будет стараться сохранить, вот только осталось выяснить на сколько часто, тяжело и объёмно их нужно нагружать. Чтобы выяснить это заглянем в исследование PMID: 11909878 под названием: «Поддержание общей мышечной силы и размера после силовых тренировок у пожилых мужчин». В нём принимали участие мужчины в возрасте около 70 лет, которые в течение 12 недель, 3 раза неделю выполняли разгибания голени в тренажёре сидя, с интенсивностью 80% от 1ПМ в 3 подходах. Оказалось, что выполнение 1/3 объёма, т.е. 3-х подходов на 1 тренировке в неделю было достаточно для поддержания силы и размера мышц в течение следующих 6 месяцев.", "created_at": "2023-05-04T08:09:44.196Z", "is_published": true, "published_at": "2023-05-04T08:09:48.230Z", "blog": 4, "profile": 6}}, {"model": "app_blog.post", "pk": 16, "fields": {"title": "тестовый новый пост", "tag": "тест", "content": "немного текста.
